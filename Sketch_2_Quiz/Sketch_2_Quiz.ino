//Quiz 2

/*
Hints: You can name variables whatever you want, but be consistent
       You can check your code with the check mark before you turn it in.
       You can use the arduino reference website: 
       https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage

//Variables (pins).
// all variables start with int, a space, the variable name, equals, number, ;

         //LED is connected to pin 11
         //Button is connected to pin 12

//start with setup routine to tell the arduino what to do with the pins

void setup() {
  /*
  Hint: use the pinMode() function.
  */
     //set led_pin to output to send electricity out
     //set button_pin to input to sense electricity
}

//start the main loop

void loop() {
  //create a new variable and check the if the button is pressed.
  /*
  so this time, set the variable equal to digitalRead function 
  */
  
  
  //check if there was voltage there.
  //in the parenthesis, set the variable == HIGH to see if there was voltage
  if( ){
    //if there was, turn on the LED
    //use the digitalWrite function
    
  }
  else{
    //if not, turn LED off
    //use the digitalWrite function
    
  }
  
}
